This is a screenshot of the final step I completed! 

<h2>Description</h2>
In this lab we gained access to a target system using a RAT Trojan. We also figured out how to hide it from a naked eye through SwayzCryptor. We then figured out how to infect a target system with a virus. After that the next steps were focused on the blue side of the lab. We performed a lot for scanning and disassembles for static malware analysis. We then performed dynamic malware analysis using a variety of tools to look at every point where malware could be hiding. I prefer the dynamic analysis tools over the static. They are just overall easier to work with.
