This is a screenshot of the final step I completed! 

<h2>Description</h2>
In this lab, I gained access to a target system using a RAT Trojan. I had to hide it from a naked eye through SwayzCryptor. The virus I created was then trasmitted to the target device through an email link. After that the next steps were focused on the blue side of the lab. This is where I switched to the target system that was infected. I performed a lot for scanning and disassembles for static malware analysis. I then performed dynamic malware analysis using a variety of tools to look at every point where malware could be hiding. I prefer the dynamic analysis tools over the static because they are just overall easier to work with.
